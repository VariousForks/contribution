        We will guide you through five steps so you are able to contribute to the project:<br>
         
        <h2>Phase 1</h2>
        1. Select or enter your Ethereum (ETH) account<br>
        2. Choose that you haven't submitted your information yet<br>
        3. Create and download a temporary Ethereum account ('Contribution wallet')<br>
        4. Enter personal information, provide scans of ID and a selfie of yourself with that ID and how much you'd like to contribute; and if not using a web wallet, accept transfer.<br>
        5. Receive acknowledgement of transfer done or information where to transfer funds with your web wallet.

        <h2>Phase 2</h2>
        After completing phase 1, when we're ready, we will invite you via email to finalize your contribution through transferring control of the Contribution Wallet to Zipper<br><br>
        
        <i>Note: You can cancel your contribution through this site anytime before completing Phase 2. Until you have completed Phase 2, no offer, sale, or any form of transaction between you and Zipper Global Ltd. has been entered into.</i><br>
